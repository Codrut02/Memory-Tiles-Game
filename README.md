# Memory Tiles Game

This is a classic memory game built using WPF and C# programming language. By implementing its features, I hope to learn more about working in WPF, as well as creating multiplayer games and working with themes. Additionally, I look forward to improving my overall programming skills by working on this project.


## Gameplay

The game is played by flipping over two tiles at a time. If the two tiles match, they remain face up. If they do not match, they are flipped back over and the player must try again. The goal is to match all of the tiles as quickly as possible.

## Features

- Customizable board sizes, maximum size: rows*columns <= 40
- Register and save new profiles
- Input error management: handle invalid user input and display appropriate error messages
